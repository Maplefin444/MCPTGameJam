# Bunbun's Adventure

Bunbun's Adventure is a winter survival game. The user spawns in an enclosed map, where they need to stay close to their house (their only source of heat). As they gather resources, the user can upgrade their heat source, allowing them to venture further and explore more of the world. The end goal is to be able to successfully exit the map. Be wary, though, as you only have one life: once your temperature bar reaches zero, it's game over.
